To getting started with modbus, the project reads received data by using existing Modbus library through pzem004.ino file. 
Then, I study deeply in how to encode and decode following Modbus RTU rule. To pratice, the Arduino kit will be used to encode the input value and send to ESP32 kit. ESP32 kit will recieve data and decode into the readable value and display.
